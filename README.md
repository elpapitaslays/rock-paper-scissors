# rock-paper-scissors
Play the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game vs your computer!

Some things about it:
- It's really basic, took me just 15 minutes, I did it because I was bored
- YOU MUST, put the inputs as exactly as they are in the code (scissors, paper or rock) (I know there's lower() function, but I'm tired and don't want to correct it)

Enjoy it
